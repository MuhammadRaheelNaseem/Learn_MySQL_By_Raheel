# Download And Installation

## Step 1:
Go to the official website of MySQL and download the community server edition software. Here, you will see the option to choose the Operating System, such as Windows.

## Step 2:
Next, there are two options available to download the setup. Choose the version number for the MySQL community server, which you want. If you have good internet connectivity, then choose the mysql-installer-web-community. Otherwise, choose the other one.

# Verify MySQL installation
Once MySQL has been successfully installed, the base tables have been initialized, and the server has been started, you can verify its working via some simple tests.

Open your MySQL Command Line Client; it should have appeared with a mysql> prompt. If you have set any password, write your password here. Now, you are connected to the MySQL server, and you can execute all the SQL command at mysql> prompt as follows:

## For example: 
Check the already created databases with show databases command:

# What is the Primary key?
A primary key is a single field or combination of fields that contain a unique record. It must be filled. None of the fields of the primary key can contain a null value. A table can have only one primary key.
